# Mini Shell
I developed Mini Shell, an alternative Linux Shell, using the C programming language. This project aimed to create a fully functional command-line interface with multiple features and functionalities, offering users a robust and efficient shell experience.

In the process of designing and implementing Mini Shell, I focused on providing users with a reliable and powerful tool for interacting with their operating system. The shell offers a range of capabilities, making it easy for users to execute commands, navigate directories, and manage processes effectively. By using the C programming language, I ensured the shell's performance was optimized, resulting in a smooth and responsive user experience. Overall, Mini Shell serves as a practical Linux Shell alternative, giving users a versatile and feature-rich command-line interface.
